hiding text on image using python and flask

The process of hiding messages is as follows:
1. The input message will be encrypted using the AES method
2. The results of the encryption will be hidden in the selected image

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The script program leverages the power of AES cryptography and steganography to ensure secure communication and protect sensitive information. By employing AES encryption, the program guarantees robust data encryption, making it virtually impenetrable to unauthorized access. In addition, steganography techniques enable the concealment of encrypted data within seemingly innocuous files, such as images or audio, thereby adding an extra layer of secrecy. This powerful combination ensures that confidential messages remain hidden from prying eyes, offering users a reliable and covert method for secure information exchange.
